Hi! This is Shashank Mahawar of class XI-E.
I have worked on Prompt 1 - Web Designing. For this I have mainly used HTML and CSS. It took me quite a while to complete the task. I have learnt most of these things
from an online app (SoloLearn) and by watching YouTube videos. Some parts of the task like the Online Shopping page (I had to write very long codes...) were quite 
challenging to me but at last I was able to overcome them. I have put in a lot of effort in this task. I want to join the famous EXUN Club not only because of my 
interest in computers but for also developing my skills by working along with the other members of the club.
Hope you like my work and I hope that I get selected for the club.
